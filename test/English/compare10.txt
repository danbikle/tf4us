Given that I load /pages/compare
I should see title:
Comparison of Long Only, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
The data from scikit-learn should come from:
  - linear_model.LinearRegression()
  - linear_model.LogisticRegression()
The data from TensorFlow should come from:
  - script/learn_tst_rpt.py
which is a simple script full of some TensorFlow API calls.
